    </p>
    <p class="Writing1">   As we trace back to 'Batman Begins' releasing in 2005 followed by the epic 'Dark Knight' (2008) and finally ending with a bang with the release of 'The Dark Knight Rises' in 2012 - we can only marvel and awe at the genius of Christopher Nolan ,who directed the entire Trilogy .Christian Bale ,playing
billionaire Bruce Wayne put on the cape and the coveted bat suit on all three occasions .Talking about the cast ,we really have a lot on our table -Michael Caine as Alfred ,Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon ,Morgan Freeman as Mr Fox and Cillian Murphy as Scarecrow appeared in all the three films. If you were shell-shocked by just that then there's more for you - Liam Neeson cameos as Ra's Al Gul in the first movie  followed by Heath Ledger's oscar winning performance  as "Joker" in the second film and we even get Tom Hardy appearing in the last film as Bane.

      Sorry guys as much as I might want to,I can't repeat the storyline of the entire trilogy for you. Instead I will talk about the evolution of Gotham's Dark Knight and how beautifully Nolan sketched every character such that they became immortal.In the first film we witnessed the death of Ra's Al Gul ,Bruce's mentor who gave a confused and aimless Bruce Wayne a new purpose in life and tried to make him more than human -tried to convince him to murder entire civilizations in the name of justice. Bruce proved he can become a hero someday when he destroyed the League of Shadows -the organisation that created him ,because he believed he can save Gotham without killing off everyone ,that he can become that ray of hope.
    </p>
      <p class="Writing3">
        Batman was a symbol - was he a symbol of peace ,for me he was a symbol of balance ,he kept both the sides of evil in check.Nolan developed the character of Bruce right from the starting when his parents died to the end when he threw the bomb into the water making himself a hero for many.The cinematography of the film is right on a different level with the action sequences and the  background score enticing us for years to come (go and check it out on youtube ).The costume designs are so accurate to the comics and the aesthetics is so dark ,it really adds to the legacy of the "Dark Knight" . Nolan is a master storyteller and he brings  into life a lot of popular characters in the franchise and even shows them in a different light ,
-  the way he portrayed Tom Hardy's "Bane " making him more than just a Batman villain and a mercenary and made made him into an icon of fear -an icon of redemption - and when Bane says this ~"Ah you think darkness is your ally? You merely adopted the dark. I was born in it, molded by it. I didn't see the light until I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but blinding!" - teaching Batman a lesson that even his ultimate weapon might turn futile ,I really was in awe of him.In the "Dark Knight" the character of Harvey Dent later becoming Two face is such a eye opener that society leaves the good people to hang and use their kind hearts to unleash madness beyond imagination - " You Either Die A Hero, Or You Live Long Enough To See Yourself Become The Villain”.

        I wanna end this article by paying tribute to one of my most favourite artists who has become one with the stars in a sky  full of legends - "I am not someone who is loved. I’m an idea. A state of mind.” - Heath Ledger as Joker made Batman immortal. Every Great hero is impossible without a worthy nemesis - as Joker even pointed out that they were made for each other and won't be able to function alone. The character of Joker is gonna stay in our hearts forever  and that's only because of the epic demonstration of a psychotic maniac with a purpose played  to perfection by Heath.Do let me know your thoughts about the Dark Knight franchise and I will meet you next time with another interesting piece.
